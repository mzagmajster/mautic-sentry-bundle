# Mautic Sentry Bundle


Empty Mautic plugin bundle (zero functionality). Tested on **Mautic 3.3.3**. Go ahead use this boilerplate and provide more custom functionality to Mautic - Open source Marketing Automation Tool.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Composer
* Mautic 4


### Installing

Use hooks from .githooks folder on project by executing:

```
./bin/init.sh
```

**Initial install** described below.

```
cd <mautic-root-folder>
rm -rf var/cache/dev/* var/cache/prod/*
cd plugins
git clone <repo-url> MZagmajsterSentryBundle
cd <mautic-root-folder>
composer install  # You only need this druing development.
php bin/console mautic:plugins:install --dev  # You should get a message saying one or more plugins have been installed in terminal.
```

Update the values in parameters array in ```Config/config.php``` so it describes your project and connects to your Sentry account via DSN.

```
'parameters'  => [
        'mzagmajster_sentry_dsn'          => '',  // Sentry DSN
        'mzagmajster_sentry_environment'  => '',  // string describing software env. (like staging, production,...)
        'mzagmajster_sentry_sw_release'   => '1.0.7',  // Release version of plugin you are monitoring.
        'mzagmajster_sentry_log_level'    => \Monolog\Logger::ERROR,  // Log level at which we send log entry to Sentry.
        'mzagmajster_sentry_log_bubble'   => true,  // Turn on/off bubble mode
        'mzagmajster_sentry_project_root' => '/var/www/html/mautic',
    ],
```


Typical **update** of plugin source code described below.

* Make sure plugin root folder is clean from gitÂ´s point of view.

```
cd <mautic-root-folder>
rm -rf var/cache/dev/* var/cache/prod/*
cd plugins/MZagmajsterSentryBundle
git pull origin <branch>
php bin/console mautic:plugins:reload --dev  # You should get a message saying one or more plugins have been installed in terminal.
```

## Running the tests

### Coding style

Please refer to PHP CS file for details on coding styles.

From plugin root folder you can also run the following commands during development.

* ```composer lint``` - Checks the PHP syntax.
* ```composer checkcs``` - Checks code formatting && show what should be fixed (does not touch source files).
* ```composer fixcs``` - Fixes code formatting (updates soruce files).

## Deployment

* You do not have to install any composer packages inside plugin folder since we only use it during development.
* When you are deploying the plugin make sure you call ```php bin/console``` command without --dev switch.
